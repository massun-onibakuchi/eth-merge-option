## Post-Merge, `DIFFICULTY` opcodes changes

> Additionally, changes proposed by [this EIP](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399) allow for smart contracts to determine whether the upgrade to the PoS has already happened. This can be done by analyzing the return value of the DIFFICULTY opcode. A value greater than 2\*\*64 indicates that the transaction is being executed in the PoS block.
